# Markdown Renderer

This project provides a simple, single-page web application designed to render Markdown content from an `input.md` file into HTML using JavaScript. It leverages [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modern, responsive design and [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for efficient Markdown parsing.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Automatically fetches `input.md` and converts its content to HTML.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a great user experience on various screen sizes.
*   **Easy Deployment:** A single `index.html` file makes it incredibly easy to deploy.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:** All rendering logic is handled client-side in the browser.

## Getting Started

To run this application:

1.  **Save the files:** Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are in the same directory.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The application will automatically load `input.md` and display its rendered content.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS):** For styling and responsive layout.
*   **JavaScript (Marked.js):** For fetching and parsing Markdown content.
